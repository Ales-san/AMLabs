Simplex method implementation
input:
 - aim function's coefficients
 - basis vectors
 - matrix of linear equations system's cofficients
 
 result: 
 - system that is changed with gauss method for basis vectors (basis vectors are shifted to the beginning)
 - result for aim function
 - numbers of the final basis vectors
